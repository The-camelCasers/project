# The camelCasers Group Project: Do You Need An Umbrella?

## Description

"Do You Need An Umbrella" is a simple weather application. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. Three APIs are utilized in this website:

- [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com/)
- [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

The first time the app is opened in a browser, the user will see a pop up asking if they will allow or block location information.

If the user clicks "Allow", they are presented with the header "Do You Need an Umbrella?". In the center of the screen is an input box with text "Enter yo zipcode", with a search button below. Beneath the search button will be a box displaying the current weather and whether or not the user needs an umbrella. A randomly picked gif in the theme of the current weather is displayed as the background image. The user can also manually enter a zip code and search for a location other than their own.

If the user clicks "Block", they are presented with the header "Do You Need an Umbrella?". In the center of the screen is an input box with text "Enter yo zipcode", with a search button below. When the user enters a zip code and clicks the "Search" button, the current weather is displayed, along with whether or not the user needs an umbrella. A randomly picked gif in the theme of the current weather is displayed as the background image. If the zipcode box is left blank, or if a valid zip code is not entered, text will display asking the user to "Please enter a valid zip code.", and a randomly picked "error" gif will display as the background.

There is a footer at the bottom of the page with links to the LinkedIn profiles of all the developers.

There is a blue footer at the bottom of the page with clickable links to the developers LinkedIn pages.  If the user selects "Allow" when asked if the app can know their location, text appears with the current weather and whether or not the user needs an umbrella at their current location.  A random gif in the theme of the current weather is displayed as the background.  In the center is a white oval with black text "Enter yo zip code".  When you hover over the oval, the background color turns light blue.  The user can manually enter a zip code to get the weather, umbrella requirement, and weather gif for that location.](./assets/img/geolocation_ss.png)
